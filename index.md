## About
Contemporary algorithms for time series management predominantly handle univariate time series. Modern data sources frequently generate richer, multivariate time series. Examples include sensors monitoring multiple variables (e.g., temperature, wind, rainfall), financial time series (bid/ask prices, volume), and data from scientific and medical equipment. Currently, only very few algorithms address the management, analysis, and extraction of insights from such multivariate data. Moreover, existing work is tailored to specific needs. Foundational functionalities that have propelled advancements in univariate time series analysis, e.g., indexing, cannot be trivially extended to the multivariate case. This limitation significantly restricts existing efforts for analyzing multivariate time series. 

This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners working with multivariate time series, to present and discuss open problems and solutions, and to foster collaborations. Industry will participate for presenting requirements and current approaches, and to reach out to the ICDE community. Researchers will share their novel and ongoing work. The full-day workshop will feature:
(a) 10 paper presentations (short papers and demos up to 6 pages, long papers up to 12 pages),
(b) two invited talks from industry and domain experts, 
(c) panel discussion, and time for fostering collaborations. 

The accepted papers will be included in the ICDEW proceedings.

## Keynote Talks
To be announced.

<!-- ##### Keynote 1: Multivariate Time-Series in Airbus 
*Ammar Mechouche, Airbus Helicopters; Adil Soubki, Airbus Commercial*

**Abstract:** This presentation is about Airbus time series coming from testing aircrafts and operating helicopters. First, the collection and management of these data are briefly described. Then, it is shown how these time series data are organized and stored in order for their processing to be performant. After that, some Airbus made tools, dedicated to time series analysis, are presented. Finally, a focus is made on problems / challenges emerging from the analysis of these multivariate data series, encountered in the framework of predictive maintenance and automatic events detection in testing data.

##### Keynote 2: Multivariate time series in healthcare: challenges and open questions 
*Laurent Oudre, Centre Borelli, ENS Paris Saclay*

**Abstract:** Most sensors currently used in healthcare (EEG, 3D motion analysis, accelerometry, ECG...) produce multivariate time series. The different dimensions of these time series are often highly correlated and structured, and prior knowledge of the structure can help to improve the way these signals are handled and processed. In this talk we will discuss some strategies to exploit this additional information for various tasks such as change point detection or filtering, with applications to gait analysis and EEG data. The talk will also provide an introductory overview of the promising framework of Graph Signal Processing (GSP), along with a discussion of the main remaining challenges and open questions in this area.
